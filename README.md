GPT-from-Scratch (Decoder-only Transformer)
This repository implements a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model built from scratch using a decoder-only transformer architecture. The model leverages self-attention mechanisms to generate coherent text based on the provided training data.

Key Features:

Self-Attention Mechanism: Captures long-range dependencies and context within the text.
Decoder-Only Architecture: Designed for autoregressive text generation (one token at a time).
End-to-End Workflow: Training and text generation are combined in a single Python script (gpt.py) for ease of use.
Text Generation: After training, the model can generate text step-by-step, predicting the next token based on the previous ones.
Requirements:

Python 3.7+
PyTorch 1.9+
NumPy
Install the dependencies:

Bash
pip install torch numpy
Use code with caution.

How to Use:

1. Training the Model:

Run the following command to initiate training:

Bash
python gpt.py
Use code with caution.

The script utilizes a default dataset (you can modify the path within the script to use your own data). During training, the model learns to predict the next token in the sequence, with loss printed periodically.

2. Text Generation:

Once training is complete, the model is ready for text generation. The script includes built-in functionality. Modify the code to change the initial seed or prompt, and the model will generate text step-by-step based on its learned patterns.

Model Architecture:

The model employs a decoder-only transformer, a simplified version of the original Transformer architecture. Key components include:

Self-attention Mechanism: Enables the model to compute relationships between all tokens within the input sequence, focusing on relevant parts regardless of their position.
Decoder-Only Model: Utilizes only the decoder block of the transformer for autoregressive text generation. Each output token is generated by predicting the next token in the sequence, conditioned on the previously generated tokens.

This file encompasses the entirety of the code for both training the model and generating text. It includes:

Definition of the transformer model with the self-attention mechanism.
Training loop for learning from the dataset.
Text generation functionality for after training.
Hyperparameters:

The gpt.py script allows adjustment of the following hyperparameters:

batch_size: Number of training samples processed together in a batch.
block_size: Length of the sequence input for each training step.
learning_rate: Learning rate for optimization.
epochs: Number of training iterations over the dataset.
eval_interval: Frequency for evaluating and printing the model's training loss.
These parameters are hardcoded within the script for simplicity. Modify them within the script to experiment with different settings.

Example Workflow:

Run python gpt.py to begin training on your dataset. The training loss will be printed at regular intervals.
Upon training completion, the model's weights are saved, allowing it to generate text based on the learned knowledge.
Modify the seed input within the script for text generation. The model will generate text token-by-token, continuing from the provided seed.
Future Improvements:

Custom Datasets: Extend the script to support various text datasets with customizable preprocessing steps (e.g., tokenization).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement argument parsing to configure hyperparameters like batch_size, learning_rate, etc., from the command line.
Model Checkpoints: Add functionality to save model checkpoints during training to avoid losing progress in case of interruptions.
Advanced Text Generation: Implement temperature sampling, top-k sampling, or other techniques to enhance the quality and creativity of generated text.

Notes:

Simplicity: The project prioritizes simplicity and ease of understanding, with all code for both training and text generation consolidated within a single script.
Text Generation: The autoregressive nature of the model means it generates text one token at a time, predicting each token based on the previous ones.
